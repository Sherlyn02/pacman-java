# Pacman Game App in Java

This repository contains a simple Pacman Game App implemented in Java. The game is a recreation of the classic Pacman arcade game, where the player controls Pacman to navigate a maze, eat pellets, avoid ghosts, and clear the level.

## Features

- Intuitive keyboard controls: Use arrow keys to navigate Pacman through the maze.
- Pellets and Power Pellets: Collect all pellets in the maze to complete the level. Eating a Power Pellet allows Pacman to temporarily eat ghosts.
- Ghosts: Avoid the ghosts, or eat them when powered up by a Power Pellet.
- Scoring: Score points by eating pellets and ghosts. Challenge yourself to achieve a high score!
